better testimony from the records of the Monks themselves.
A slight inspectiones tbe names of the different brethren
will be sufficient to prove that they were, with scarcely
an exception, of anglo-saxon origin. We may add to this
the practice common in earlier timeS, at least, of choosing

houses, who were also exclusirely Anglo-Saxons. We ’

in the assertion of their own independence was a popular
cause. Besides, while the Bishops were employed about
the Court, the Monks resided in the middle of their
estates; while the Prelates were employed in matters of
state, the Monks had the education of the people. The
demand made by monasteries sor various excellence and
skill promoted various kinds of learning, and fostercd

amelioration of the lower orders, it prevented a relapse to
barbarism and infidelity,-to the state of torpor amount·

for independence, and in the second step consequent upon
it, wealth and power to carry out their intentions and
principles, these houses were greatly favoured, not only by
the people at large, but even by the Norman Barons. Po-
litic principles would induce many to do this; they would
