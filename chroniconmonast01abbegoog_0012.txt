the more patriarchal govemment of the AnglofSaxons
—morc' mild as it was more religious in its character—
the power of the Prince was a reflection of the power ·
of the Lord3 it was in a manner derived from him, as his
, was from the father of the family. Each great landowner
formed a centre round which his tenants and his vassals
gathered3 each one had little or no connexion with
other Lords, uo systematis form, no clear line of de·'

justice to the ecclesiastical as wellas to the civil power.
And how thoroughly the Norman Kings had learned to
persuade themselves of the truth of it, how well they had

riously argued. ’

It was not to be expected that the principles thus pro-
mulgated by the Norman Sovereigns, and upheld by them
with so much tyranny and oppression, should not, sooner
or later, be turned against themselves, even had their
reigns been less marked than they were with violence and
